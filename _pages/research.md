## ðŸ”­ My Research  

I am passionate about **astronomy and astrophysics**, particularly in:  

- **Galactic Evolution** â€“ Understanding how galaxies form and evolve  
- **Stellar Populations** â€“ Studying stars in **low-metallicity environments**  
- **Spectroscopic Analysis** â€“ Working with **multi-wavelength astronomy**  

ðŸš€ I am currently researching the **Magellanic Bridge**, exploring its stellar populations and implications for early universe conditions.
